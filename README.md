RaagTune 

A High Quality, Reliable and Easy to Use DISCORD MUSIC BOT!


RaagTune Discord music bot was created with one goal

 -to provide the best music experience on Discord.
 -to provide all the features for completely 'FREE'.

It provides the best music quality than any other Discord bots for Free.


RaagTune was originally created almost 2 years ago.It was a private bot for our Discord server.But now we have decided to go public and deliver the best music experience to everyone.

It is currently in public-test phase. Which means we will only be able to provide our services to few Discord servers only.

RaagTune currently provides following features:

- Auto Play: Once a playlist is added to the Queue, RaagTune will automatically play all the song till the queue is empty.

-Search and Play: Just type in the song name and RaagTune will automatically find the best match for your query and play it.

-Queue: Shows all the songs in the queue.

-Now Playing: Shows the currently playing song.

-Stop: Stops the player and leaves the channel.

-Skip: Skips the currently playing song.

-Pause: Pauses currently playing song.

-Repeat: Repeats currently playing song.

-Loop: Loops the entire Queue.

-Loopoff: Turn off repeat and loop. .

-Resume: Resumes paused song.

-Volume: Lets you change the Volume

-SetPrefix: Set a custom Prefix for your Guild.

More features will be added in the future...

Although we are completely free but still we need to pay for our servers, So any voluntary Donations are very much appreciated :)
