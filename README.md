# RaagTune ðŸŽ¶

**A High-Quality, Reliable, and Easy-to-Use Discord Music Bot**

RaagTune was created with a simple mission: to provide the best music experience on Discord **for free**. It delivers unparalleled music quality among Discord bots, making it the ideal choice for music lovers.

Initially launched almost two years ago as a private bot for our Discord server, RaagTune is now going public, bringing an exceptional music experience to everyone. Currently, itâ€™s in a public-test phase, which means access is limited to a select number of Discord servers.

## Key Features

- **Auto Play**: Once a playlist is added to the queue, RaagTune automatically plays all songs until the queue is empty.
- **Search and Play**: Simply type the song name, and RaagTune finds and plays the best match.
- **Queue**: View all songs in the queue.
- **Now Playing**: Displays the currently playing song.
- **Stop**: Stops playback and leaves the channel.
- **Skip**: Skips to the next song in the queue.
- **Pause**: Pauses the current song.
- **Repeat**: Repeats the current song.
- **Loop**: Loops the entire queue.
- **Loop Off**: Disables repeat and loop modes.
- **Resume**: Resumes a paused song.
- **Volume Control**: Adjusts playback volume.
- **Set Prefix**: Set a custom command prefix for your server.
- **Rank**: View your rank and experience points.
- **Leaderboard**: Displays the global leaderboard of the top 10 users.

More features will be added soon!
