RaagTune ðŸŽ¶
A High-Quality, Reliable, and Easy-to-Use Discord Music Bot

RaagTune was created with a simple mission: to provide the best music experience on Discord for free. It delivers unparalleled music quality among Discord bots, making it the ideal choice for music lovers.

Initially launched almost two years ago as a private bot for our Discord server, RaagTune is now going public, bringing an exceptional music experience to everyone. Currently, itâ€™s in a public test phase, which means access is limited to a select number of Discord servers.

â—¦ Auto Play: Once a playlist is added to the queue, RaagTune automatically plays all songs until the queue is empty.
â—¦ Search and Play: Simply type the song name, and RaagTune finds and plays the best match.
â—¦ Queue: View all songs in the queue.
â—¦ Now Playing: Displays the currently playing song.
â—¦ Stop: Stops playback and leaves the channel.
â—¦ Skip: Skips to the next song in the queue.
â—¦ Pause: Pauses the current song.
â—¦ Repeat: Repeats the current song.
â—¦ Loop: Loops the entire queue.
â—¦ Loop Off: Disables repeat and loop modes.
â—¦ Resume: Resumes a paused song.
â—¦ Volume Control: Adjusts playback volume.
â—¦ Set Prefix: Set a custom command prefix for your server.
â—¦ Rank: View your rank and experience points.
â—¦ Leaderboard: Displays the global leaderboard of the top 10 users.

More features will be added soon!
